# docs-MySQL
This small project is a basic document management system using a MySQL database to store information about and references to documents I wrote for my consulting clients (does not include the documents themselves).

I wrote this to teach myself MySQL, HTML, PHP and JavaScript.

As it uses PHP it needs a webserver, which is a bit pointless as it's designed to be a single-user system running on the same system as the MySQL database. So it would be a lot simpler to access the database directly from the JavaScript code - but learning PHP was one of my main objectives for writing this code.
